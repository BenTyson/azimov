# Clarify

**Think better in an age of noise.**

Clarify is a platform for structured thinking and nuanced understanding. It helps you explore complex topics from multiple perspectives, articulate your own views, and track how your thinking evolves.

## Why Clarify?

We're drowning in information but starving for understanding. Social media rewards hot takes over nuance. Echo chambers reinforce what we already believe. Complex issues get reduced to binary positions.

Clarify is different:

- **Privacy-first**: Your thoughts stay on your device by default
- **Epistemic humility**: We acknowledge uncertainty
- **Steel-manning**: Every perspective in its strongest form
- **Slow thinking**: Designed for depth, not engagement

## Features

### Personal Thinking Journal
Write about what you're exploring. Surface your assumptions. Note your uncertainties. Watch how your thinking evolves over time.

### Topic Exploration (Coming Soon)
Complex topics presented with multiple perspectives—not false equivalence, but the genuine landscape of thought.
